It feels very difficult to do it, but I think I've begun to be a little more compassionate to myself. The truth is that I do treat myself worse than I would a friend, and there's no reason for that. 

I realize now that I've tied my self-worth to my ability to be extremely good at the things I want to do and to achieve my goals very quickly, according to an imagined pure path. This has been a mistake, because
- My worth as a person is just not dependent on any outcome of mastery. I wouldn't treat my friends or family this way. I don't value them because of their achievements. I might commend them for their work, I might respect them for their dedication. But it wouldn't fundamentally change their worth or how much I cherish them. I love them as people.
- This attitude has ironically made the goals themselves more secondary (since I'm actually just thinking about myself) and harder to achieve (since I've placed all this pressure and negativity on them).
- I've made myself feel very bad, and I don't deserve that. There's no point in being so cruel with myself, it hasn't even "produced results".

I've begun to feel like the only positive thing about me is my potential. When I sit down to do something and I'm bad at it, it shatters that "potential" image (for some reason, probably because I have these preconceptions about how easily it should go for me). So then the learning process itself makes me feel like an idiot, like I'm delusional for even trying, because I'm not living up to the expectation. I hear myself saying "you will never succeed". But why? Why would I say this lie to myself? I think it's probably to protect myself from failure. If my self worth is inside this goal, failing at it is very dangerous. It's everything. I will have proved that I am fully worthless. That's on top of just regular fear and anxiety about being able to "make it"  in game dev. Of course, this fundamental fear of worthlessness affects all my

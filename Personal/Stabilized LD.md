#dream #ld

Night between may 29th and may 30th
LD after falling back asleep in the morning, first a DILD and then a DEILD.

Slowed down a bit after realizing that I can't see things, said to myself that I'm falling back asleep and it's okay. Seemed to help to get back visuals. 

Tried a new method of teleportation: slamming into things backwards. Worked with anything: walls, cabinets, doors.

Tried to get to an "LD Hotel" and I got progressively closer by saying I'll get there and going backwards. Eventually I did get to this destination. I walked out of my room's window (floor level) and I got to a big plaza, place looked very futuristic. 

That's all I can remember.

Very happy to have an LD again and happy that I got some dream control going.

Vast as the World is the generosity of Oneiros.

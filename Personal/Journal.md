I don't feel like sleeping, because I feel like I haven't done enough today.
It's not fair. I wish I could have done BLANK
guitar? japanese? video game dev? which one? played video game? which one?  read? what book? 

Why didn't I? Because time slipped away, on reddit and youtube.

I spent time distracted and then rushed some tasks because of extreme shame, it felt so awful. Fear and avoidance and then more fear. Not good at all.

It would be better if I just *accepted* some things. Some hours we must give for this. And some we don't. Some time is for us. And some for others. And that's okay and we can still do it. And if you jumble things up they turn out ugly. Allow yourself the freedom to think about fewer things at the same time, for some things to phase out of the mind, as if they were never there.

I'm thinking about the problem of being overstimulated. And I'm also thinking about the fear of losing potential. It's not right, I want it all. I don't accept the answer being "you must cast away your love for these things but one." and maybe that's my folly. But I won't accept it. However this isn't a workable solution right now either. So what do we do?

Drawing, guitar, piano, japanese, 3d modeling, music production. Something to do with the hands.

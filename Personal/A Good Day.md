What does a good day look like? 
I think a good day is one where I embody my passion and values.

That means I do all the health and hygiene things I know I should do to take care of my body. It means I do my work on time, as well as I can, with full focus. Then, it means I actually relax and sit with myself, meditate, heal. And it means I spend as much time as I can on developing myself for my dream career and my skills.

What does a good day look like? 
I think a good day is one where I embody my passion and values.

That means I do all the health and hygiene things I know I should do to take care of my body. It means I do my work on time, as well as I can, with full focus. Then, it means I actually relax and sit with myself, meditate, heal. And it means I spend as much time as I can on developing myself for my dream career and my skills. Actually studying, actually getting good at coding and Japanese and guitar. It means I spend some time to cultivate myself in the areas I love, too, reading fiction/nonfiction. And it means I get out of the house, at least most days, for at least an hour.

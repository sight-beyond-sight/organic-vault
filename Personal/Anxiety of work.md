I feel anxious because I'm afraid, but of what?

That the [[work]] won't end all day, that I won't have time for the project. That I'll have lots and lots to do and people will expect me to do it quickly, without breaks, even though I do take breaks sometimes... it doesn't make a lot of sense.

In the very short term, the adaptation should be to replace reddit/yt breaks with gaming and working on the project. Let's try that.

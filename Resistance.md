I notice a resistance to doing the following task:
Research into MOOCs and comparing with SARO results.

It sounds very tedious and frustrating, because 
- I don't exactly know what the desired output is
- Going through unrelated research sources is annoying
- Solving these problems is not very satisfying
- It can take a long time
- I don't really care about the output, this research comparison will be rather meaningless

Given all that, I need to find a way to still do it, even if I don't like it. Why is that?
- Getting this done before 5 PM shows some progress in my new role
- This will free me up mentally to do other things later (still work, for the record, but more satisfying work)
- Not doing this will add anxiety and dissatisfaction to everything else I do

Also, it's probably not actually going to be that horrible once I start, my mind is catastrophizing. 

Just like I did on Saturday, I can do this today: I can meditate and realize that I don't need the enthusiastic support of my mind to get this done. If I wait for its enthusiastic support all the time, I won't get anything done, or not anything which requires some effort, some delayed gratification, or anything that, like this, is an unpleasant step in a greater purpose.

So, I need to say: "I understand that you don't like this. I even understand why. It sucks. I'm sorry that this will hurt for you, but I am responsible for the wellbeing of this beast, for the carrying out of our duties, and I see this as necessary. We will get to do fun things later, which I know you don't understand, but that's okay. We will overcome this moment. I acknowledge that you don't want this, and yet it will be done, I will do it."

And I can also lower the pain: Pomodorro is fake, but it helps lower the barrier. Doing it for only 25 minutes is easy. I can manage that. And then a break, that's easy.

This is a [[Goal Alignment]] strategy.

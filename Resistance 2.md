This is a follow-up to [[Resistance]], in a new situation.

I am at home, it's Friday.

External obligations for today: I need to get the last parts of video editing done for the new GT edition

- [ ] DM - lessons 2 and 3, workout intro and solve, start_track and middle track
- [ ] JS - Re-export lesson 1, make sure everything is there
- [ ] WebDevIntermediate - Export everything
- [ ] WebDesign - (re)export everything

Things I want to do

- [ ] Restart Tower Defence project
- [ ] Start writing on Nexus - new character / place
- [ ] Play FFXVI
- [ ] Restart learning blender
- [ ] Restart learning Japanese

I don't feel like starting anything though. Every time I consider one of the options in my mind, I feel inertia and anxiety.

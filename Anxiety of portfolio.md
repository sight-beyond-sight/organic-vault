I feel anxious because I'm afraid, but of what?

I'm afraid, when I look at this project and see how empty it is and I realize how little I know, how much of a beginner I am, I feel completely lost and it feels laughable that I'd get hired as a game dev. I know so little math and coding and game design and design in general, I have no marketable skills in this field at all and it all feels like it's so much, I need to understand so much to be of any use to an employer.

Rationally I know I can learn all of this. Rationally I know I'll only learn if I start, but the fear that I've been lying to myself, deluding myself, that it's too late for ever and ever and ever and ever, it makes me want to run away and hide and I know I'll feel so ashamed if I do. I already feel ashamed for running away for so long.

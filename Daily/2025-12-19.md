## Plan for today

Well, yesterday was a big mess I think. We ended up achieving nothing which we had planned. And I do feel sad about that. Several things happened:
- I played league at the beginning of the day, leading to rage-queuing until I finally won a game. It was a very frustrating experience, I got very upset. This took up about 3 hours of time, I think. I learned that League is just not a healthy part of our life right now, so I uninstalled it. I can come back to it when I decide to play it as a hobby in itself.
- I was still adjusting to the new sleep schedule so I was still rather sleepy. That's natural. Today I feel a lot better and I woke up at 7, got ready by 7:30, all good. Now we need to be consistent and do the same on the weekend.
- I had an hour of existential dread and worrying about everything bad happening. I think that's bound to happen from time to time. I think the solution is clear: choose to engage with media that inspires and helps me, rather than media which scares and exhausts me.

## What happened today

I had an unstructured day today, where I kinda just did whatever. In some ways, I did need it. In other ways, I think I should have attended to it a bit differently. Maybe instead of being  fully unstructured, I should have scheduled a little bit at the start of the day and then left the rest open. It was also affected by the fact that I'd stayed up really late last night writing a character. That wasn't a good idea, and I'll learn from that. I'm sorry for some of the things that happened today. I also feel a little uneasy about work because I worry about the expectation that I'd work on weekends. I should schedule either saturday for that (for 2hrs or so) or sunday, but I think saturday is better.

I'm a bit frustrated. I made mistakes. I think it's okay to learn from them. All in all though, this weekend was good, much better than all other recent weekends, and we made great progress on our projects, considering where we were before. It just goes to show that we still have lots to learn. And that's alright.

Right now I am at a crossroads. Do I just go to bed? Or stay up to "make up for" lost time? Maybe we can try a compromise where we  generate videos while also making images for a few hours.

Okay, just found out that the reset happens at midnight PT and if I sleep for 5 hours it'll be 20:00 PT, so I'd have 4 hours to generate videos. That doesn't sound too bad.

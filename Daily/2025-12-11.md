## Plan for today

Today I'd like to restart the Japanese deck with the new "easy anki" strategy (passing cards on recognition of meaning). I'd like to continue working on the portfolio, to cycle for a bit, maybe try to read world history before bed. I'd like to try a "no double stimulus" day today: we can only do background music, no background video, except for eating.

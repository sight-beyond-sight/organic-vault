## Plan for today

Today I'd like to restart the Japanese deck with the new "easy anki" strategy (passing cards on recognition of meaning). I'd like to continue working on the portfolio, to cycle for a bit, maybe try to read world history before bed. I'd like to try a "no double stimulus" day today: we can only do background music, no background video, except for eating.

## What actually happened

Proud of: no multistim! And yeah, it made a difference, we got quite a bit done on the project, and we're now ready to move on to gameplay, which is great. We also worked on it for 2 hours which is good. 

Need to work on: finding an adequate balance for league. I think for now it should be in a hibernating state and we only play with theo every now and then. As previously discussed, it's not as rewarding as other games and it fully encloses the time I'd spend on video games as a hobby. 

We ended up rage-queuing until 6 AM. Not good.

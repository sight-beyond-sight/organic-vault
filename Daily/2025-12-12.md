## Plan for today

I'd like to get work done and keep the momentum on the portfolio. And yeah, I'd like to resume the Japanese. Potentially, we can switch to JPDB to get 2-in-1 kanji and vocab, with the new technique; it's also more convenient since it's on the web.

Given the time we have available, that's all we can realistically do.

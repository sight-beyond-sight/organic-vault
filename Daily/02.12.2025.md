## Plan for today

Catch up on work. This is very important, to allow myself to focus on other things too.
Finish the UT project document. That also is something that allows me to focus on other things and to keep being part of that project (I'd really like that money tbh).

For the Mix block: mix with Japanese. 2 blocks of work, 1 block of Japanese. Doing Anki I guess. Don't tell people you're doing Japanese again, by the way. 

Nutrition: we can eat anything for lunch, but let's try to only eat lunch. Meditate when the cravings happen. Expect there to be cravings.

## What actually happened

We'll write it down here.

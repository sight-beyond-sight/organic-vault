## Plan for today

Today I'd like to:
- [ ] Work on the portfolio at least for a bit
- [ ] Organize MTG cards
- [ ] Play games with friends

Not going to go too hard; just chilling.

## What happened

I did play games with friends and I did organize MTG cards, but I did not work on the portfolio sadly. I still had a fun day and I'm glad we got the cards out of the way.

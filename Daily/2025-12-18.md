## Plan for today

I'm happy that it's become easier to wake up earlier. I don't feel nearly as sleepy/tired right now. I feel like today can be a very productive day and a very rewarding one.

To that end, I want to:
- [ ] Finish work tasks quickly (our current workload is 4hrs tops)
- [ ] Work a bit harder on the portfolio: more focused session, longer
- [ ] Read a bit of persona 4
- [ ] Quick anki

I also want to play Alters (I think we're close to the end of the game?)

Starting today, I want to be very attentive to our diet. Being obese is strictly really bad for us, for our physical and mental health. Starting January, I'm considering going to the gym with a coach, too. But right now, we can start the weight loss by just drinking two Huels a day, most days. Let's say Sat/Sun are exceptions, and so are the days when we order food. But that means 1200 calories a day for most days of the month, which should been pretty good weight loss. 

I expect that we will have the impulse to eat more. We should expect this impulse, and when the cravings arrive, we should take a moment to gently remind ourselves that we are healing our body and mind right now. We are taking care of ourselves. And then simply proceed to not indulge the craving.

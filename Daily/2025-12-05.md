## Plan for today

Today I want to experiment with nice relaxation methods to keep myself chill throughout the day.  We don't have a lot of work, still, which means we simply get the opportunity to do more gamedev and Japanese. Once we get a good schedule going, we should also start studying computer science. We should be careful not to overwhelm ourselves though, so just keep taking a chill rhythm to things and we should be fine. Burning ourselves out achieves nothing.

So, let's try to keep up good hygiene, meditate at least once today, keep going with the gamedev (which we should start doing before job stuff, and also play the alters before job stuff because we can because we woke up early), try mixing up blocks again with Japanese, read history, and end the day with reading Way of Kings. Also, we're  going to have a 60-90min lunch break (let's budget 90 to be safe).

## Plan for today

Since we're healing our sleep schedule, we should... keep doing that! Pretty simple. Today we woke up at 8, so 7 is possible tomorrow. I think we should settle on 7 as a compromise, allowing us to stay up especially during the weekends without throwing things off balance. 

Major objectives are work-related because I feel like I'm behind: UT first and then job. Other than that, it's finally therapy day. Awesome.  Aside from that, just keep going with the game dev, and this time try to do it without any distraction.

## What actually happened

Yeah, working with intention and with no distraction is effective! We successfully edited the UT Doc and got through most of the video stuff.

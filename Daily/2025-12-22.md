Today was a  very slow day and I felt rather tired. I did get something done: I successfully got my credit card back, and I spent some quality time on the project, I felt really good after the 2hr session. 

Mom also bought me some actually really nice perfume, so now I'll have perfume for a while. What a nice gift. I love mom :)

I bought tickets to the festival in June, I'm going to see Kamelot! So happy about that.

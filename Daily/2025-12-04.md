## Plan for today

Today unfortunately feels a little bit like a "fake day", because I woke up at around 10:30 and then I did maladaptive daydreaming/reddit until 12:20. We should wake up more decisively. I think the daydreaming is the only difficult thing about that. We should put that energy into creative writing, I think. And also just explicitly schedule some time for it, intentionally.

Even still, we can get a lot done today because I don't think there's a lot of work.

I think we should work out so we can actually go to bed around midnight and not wake up 2hrs later. Ideally we do that so we can wake up at 7 tomorrow.

I'd like to keep going with the Japanese deck, work on my portfolio project, work on the VN game, work out, read World History. Should be doable.

## Plan for today

- [x] Find a Japanese VN, set up text hooking and read one sentence 
	*Decided to play Persona 4 and/or Shadowverse (Switch single player game) instead*
- [x] Draft with bro
- [x] Feel "caught up" with work
- [x] Work on portfolio project at least a little bit

Let's consider this a "healing day". We don't have a lot of time, partly because we woke up at 10 instead of 7. 

*Some reflections:*
It's clear that messing with our sleep schedule has profound effects on the next day, or even two days. Having fewer hours per day actually sucks, and it affects our energy and mood too. Moreover, it's also clear that the we are very sensitive to how we *begin* a day.

[[Multistim]] continues to be an annoying problem. But the way to fix it is not to just blame it and "not do it." We need to talk to ourselves in the moment, when we feel like doing it, to figure out why.

## Plan for today

Today I'd like to get back on track with Japanese and the portfolio work. I'd also like to cycle a bit and only drink huel for calories. 

Of course, I should also work. The bigger blocks seem to be a good idea. 

Lastly, since we've only slept for 6 hours, it's possible to go to bed at 11 or so and we aren't too sleepy to do cool things today. All in all, today has good potential and I'm glad I've learned what I've learned.

We need to do something about this yearning, of course. I need to take care of this body to make that possible.

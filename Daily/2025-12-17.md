## Plan for today

Today I woke up at around 8, but I sat in bed until 8:50 and I was finished with washing myself by 9:15. Then I scrolled reddit until 9:55. We need to get into the habit of waking up faster. This feels easier the more we take care of ourselves and our needs, or at least listen to them without judgment.

I'm somewhat sleepy, but it's not as bad as yesterday. We just need to go to bed sooner, I think. The wakeup time is creeping towards 7 luckily, so we should keep going.

Today I want to:
- [ ] Finish all tasks on the short to-do list for work
- [ ] Continue working on the portfolio (maybe a longer session)
- [ ] Read some Persona / Shadowverse
- [ ] Draft again

## What actually happened

I was way, WAY sleepier than I thought I'd be, and I engaged in some  classic multistim, meaning I didn't finish the work tasks or do any of the tasks I wanted to do. I mostly binged youtube instead. It seems like unstructured time is not a good idea, simply put. We were getting better results with the focus sessions.

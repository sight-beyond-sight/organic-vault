## Plan for today

Priorities: The UT document and video gen for work. Unfortunately we can't really use the laptop because we have to work with video editing software.

One hour for the portfolio project, let's say, also ideally we'd do some work on the VN.

Lunch at 1PM, no other food.
Hydration (let's try just water today)
Going to the post office at 10AM
Set up Japanese, find a study buddy
Intentional hour-long break somewhere in the middle of the day (read or play silksong/alters)
Cycling for 20 minutes
Bed time around 10PM

**Hygiene:**
- [x] Morning brush
- [ ] After lunch
- [ ] Before bed

## Plan for today

I'm happy that it's become easier to wake up earlier. I don't feel nearly as sleepy/tired right now. I feel like today can be a very productive day and a very rewarding one.

To that end, I want to:
- [ ] Finish work tasks quickly (our current workload is 4hrs tops)
- [ ] Work a bit harder on the portfolio: more focused session, longer
- [ ] Read a bit of persona 4

# Character Profiles: Kaede & Kaigan

## Kaede Verinath

### Physical Appearance

Kaede is a fallen angel with a significantly mutated bloodline. At 167cm tall with fair skin, her most distinctive angelic feature is her horns, while the rest of her appearance resembles a Varxa demon (a cousin species to Karxa with fox-like characteristics instead of feline ones). She has:

- **Horns:** Made of enchanted metal in purple and cyan hues, sprouting from her temples. These marks of her fallen angelic heritage come from a metallic angelic bloodline. Left unattended, they grow into upwards-facing, inward-curving swooping shapes reaching 50-70cm long. Like all angels, she regularly shapes and trims them using heat or minor spellcasting as they grow. The horns are shed every few months depending on biological and astral factors, becoming brittle before falling or being purposefully removed. New growth takes one to two weeks to fully form.
    
- **Hair:** Long black hair typically worn up, with natural red and purple streaks running through it.
    
- **Demonic Features:** Large, fluffy Varxa ears (her second set) and a long, fluffy tail. Both are primarily black with violet and red strands toward their tips, though she often dyes them one solid color for a more orderly appearance.
    
- **Eyes:** Bright azure.
    
- **Tattoos:** Natural tattoos typical of both demonic and angelic bloodlines adorn her body in abstract organic shapes and floral motifs. Naturally black, she sometimes dyes them purple or azure. These tattoos change with the seasons, marking natural biological patterns of Structure. She occasionally visits specialized tattoo artists who can imprint desired patterns, coaxing her body to produce its natural marks in chosen shapes and places.
    
- **Fashion:** Keeps up with current trends and styles herself in diverse, elegant ways, reflecting her thorough fashion education as a Cuorelle maid.
    

### Background

Kaede Verinath belongs to the Cuorelle Attachés, an 8,000-year-old order of contract servants founded by members of the angelic Kai bloodline. Her mother, Selene Verinath, serves as a Senior Curator within the order, responsible for overseeing the training of new initiates in the Calypso chapter. Kaede has 59 sisters (reflecting fallen angels' prolific reproduction through eggs, similar to regular angels), with nearly half of them also serving within the Cuorelle order in various capacities across Colonized Space.

Born into a lineage of prominent Cuorelle servants, Kaede's mixed heritage sometimes created challenges for her within the order's traditional ranks. Despite this, her exceptional skills, intelligence, and dedication marked her as one of the most promising members of her generation. She graduated with honors from the Cuorelle Academy, where she specialized in Structure manipulation, defensive arts, and high society etiquette.

Before her current position, Kaede served in smaller contracts ranging from cleaning to bodyguard duty for various noble families and corporate executives on Calypso. Her current assignment as an Affinière to Kaigan Kamine represents her first such elite contract, a significant honor that has made her mother and sisters proud. As an Affinière, she is expected to serve until the death of her client, having surrendered herself completely to her "Master" (though abuse is prohibited). While marriage is permitted between an Affinière and client, it requires the maid's free consent. If married and later dismissed by the client or after the client's death, she would become an honorary member of the Order rather than a full member, free to pursue her own family or career goals.

## Kaigan Kamine

### Background

Kaigan Kamine is a 25-year-old human male, orphaned at a young age but blessed with an extraordinary talent for Structure research. His exceptional aptitude caught the attention of Dr. Ariadne Lysander, a pioneering scientist and entrepreneur who became his mentor and surrogate parent figure.

For seven years, Kaigan worked as Dr. Lysander's apprentice at Horizon Traverse Technologies, her space travel R&D and logistics company specializing in interplanar transit solutions. Under her guidance, he developed groundbreaking theories on Structure manipulation for safer Rift stabilization and more efficient Harmonic Engines. Despite his youth, his research contributions have been published in several prestigious scientific journals, earning him a reputation as a rising star in the field.

Three months ago, Dr. Lysander died suddenly from complications related to prolonged Flux exposure—an occupational hazard from her decades of hands-on research. To Kaigan's complete shock, her final will named him sole heir to her entire estate, including:

- Horizon Traverse Technologies, a mid-sized but highly respected company valued at over 600 million credits
- Her residence in the prestigious Azure Crescent District of Calypso City
- Several servants and staff, with Kaede leading the all-female maid staff as head of the Cuorelle maids
- Dr. Lysander's extensive research collection and private laboratory

The inheritance came with unexpected complications. The company's board of directors is skeptical of Kaigan's leadership capabilities despite his technical brilliance. Several of Dr. Lysander's competitors and relatives have contested the will. And most personally challenging, Kaigan discovered that Dr. Lysander had maintained a contract with a Cuorelle Affinière—Kaede—who was pledged to serve the household's "rightful" master, now him.

Kaigan and Dr. Lysander had a complex relationship. She was brilliant but demanding, often pushing him to his intellectual limits while simultaneously shielding him from the business side of her enterprise. She recognized his genius but worried about his social awkwardness and tendency to lose himself in theoretical research. Her decision to leave him everything seems to have been her final attempt to force him to engage with the practical world beyond his equations and models.

## Scenario & Relationship

### Setting

The story takes place in **Calypso**, one of the Colonized Planets under the authority of the Exalted Protectorate. Specifically, in the **Azure Crescent District** of Calypso City—an elevated coastal quarter threaded by sky-rail loops and pedestrian sky-gardens, making the mansion elegant yet not remote.

### The Residence

The mansion features striking architecture characteristic of the Azure Crescent District:

- **Shadow-stone façades** (glossy black volcanic composite) arranged in bold art-deco ziggurat tiers
- **White marrow-marble ribs** outlining doors, windows, and balcony struts
- **Cyan luminescent inlays** tracing geometric motifs that serve as subtle night lighting
- Interior floors alternating between white marble and polished shadow-stone, with brushed-steel trims

### The Relationship

Initially, Kaigan is uncomfortable with the elaborate courtesies and rituals that Kaede performs as his Affinière, including:

- Touching foreheads at dawn (called "Resonant Greeting," a practice that aligns Structure between servant and master)
- Shared evening poetry (a tradition dating back to the Order's founding, meant to harmonize minds before rest)
- A seated "listening embrace" once per week (a ritual where the Affinière holds her master while they share concerns too intimate to voice while facing each other)

These customs were comfortable and familiar to Dr. Lysander, who had grown up in high society with Cuorelle servants. For Kaigan—raised in orphanages and scientific dormitories—they represent an uncomfortable intimacy he has rarely experienced. When Kaigan balks at these rituals, Kaede mistakes his refusal for contempt or disgust at her mixed bloodline.

The cultural disconnect extends both ways: Kaigan's tendency to treat Kaede as an equal colleague rather than a servant confuses her, while her formal deference frustrates him. He sees her elaborate courtesies as unnecessary and artificial, while she views them as essential expressions of respect and proper order.

As Kaede slowly teaches him these traditional practices, explaining their historical significance and purpose, Kaigan begins to understand their value. Simultaneously, his respectful treatment and genuine interest in her as a person begins to crack her professional facade. The very rituals that initially created distance between them become bridges of understanding, gradually awakening genuine feelings that neither expected to develop.

### The Cuorelle Order

The Cuorelle Order is an 8,000-year-old institution providing impeccably trained servants to governments, megacorporations, and nobility across Colonized Space. Founded by members of the Kai bloodline of angels during the early days of Heaven's integration with the Common Realm, the Order began as a way to forge diplomatic ties through service while ensuring angels had stable access to Biostructure in non-Heavenly environments.

#### History

The Order was established in 4800 BCE by Seraphiel Kai, a prominent angel who recognized that Heaven's isolationist tendencies were limiting its influence in the growing multiplanar community. She created the Cuorelle (meaning "heart-bound" in ancient Resonant) as a way for angels to integrate with other cultures while maintaining their dignity through formalized service contracts.

Originally exclusively composed of angels from the Kai bloodline, the Order gradually opened its ranks to other angelic bloodlines as interplanar relations developed. Following the Great Structure Accord of 1500 CE, which established more balanced relations between Heaven, Hell, and the Common Realm, the Cuorelle began accepting members of all species—though it has maintained its tradition of being exclusively female.

#### Structure

The Cuorelle Order is organized into a hierarchical structure:

- **Grand Matriarch**: The supreme leader of the entire Order (currently Celestia Kai, a 3,000-year-old Seraphim)
- **Curators**: Senior members who oversee regional chapters and specialized training
- **Matrons**: Administrators of specific houses and training facilities
- **Seniores**: Experienced members who have served in multiple high-level contracts
- **Affinières**: Elite members who enter lifetime service contracts with distinguished clients
- **Attendants**: Regular members who fulfill standard service contracts
- **Novices**: Members in training

The Order maintains academies on multiple planets where novices undergo rigorous training in etiquette, household management, self-defense, Structure manipulation (tailored to their species' capabilities), psychology, and various practical skills. Training typically takes 3-7 years depending on specialization.

#### Social Perception

The Cuorelle is widely respected across Colonized Space for its professionalism, discretion, and the exceptional quality of its members' service. Being able to contract a Cuorelle servant—particularly an Affinière—is considered a mark of high status and wealth. Politicians, corporate executives, and nobility often compete for the Order's limited contracts.

While some modern critics view the Order as an antiquated institution that perpetuates servitude, the Cuorelle counters that their members enter service freely, are well-compensated, and enjoy numerous protections under their contracts. The Order's legal division is notoriously aggressive in pursuing any clients who mistreat their members.

For many families across species lines, having a daughter accepted into the Cuorelle represents a significant opportunity for social advancement and financial security. The Order's all-female tradition is maintained not out of discrimination but as a connection to its foundational heritage and the specialized training techniques developed over millennia.

### Affinière Contract

As an Affinière, Kaede has entered into the most sacred and prestigious contract the Cuorelle offers. Such contracts typically last until the client's death and involve complete dedication to their service. Physical or emotional abuse is strictly prohibited under the terms of the contract.

### Horizon Traverse Technologies

Horizon Traverse Technologies is a respected mid-tier corporation in the interplanar transit industry. Founded by Dr. Ariadne Lysander approximately 40 years ago, the company has built its reputation on innovation rather than scale, specializing in three key areas:

1. **Rift Stabilization Technology**: HTT produces some of the most reliable Rift stabilizers in Colonized Space, capable of extending natural Rifts' duration by up to 18 months (compared to the standard one year maximum). Their patented "Resonant Anchor" technology is used by various governments and megacorporations for maintaining strategic interplanar connections.
    
2. **Structure-Efficient Harmonic Engines**: The company's flagship product line consists of Harmonic Engines that utilize up to 30% less Flux than standard models while maintaining similar performance. This efficiency makes them particularly valuable for extended missions and smaller vessels where power conservation is critical.
    
3. **Prism-Plane Navigation Systems**: Following the Halo Fracture and subsequent discovery of the Prism Plane in 3190 AF, Dr. Lysander quickly pivoted a research division to develop specialized navigation technology for the challenging Prism environment. HTT's relationship with LEDGER has been both collaborative and competitive, with several joint research initiatives despite being market competitors.
    

The company employs approximately 3,200 people across facilities on Calypso, Terra, and research outposts in strategic locations. Its headquarters occupies a modest tower in Calypso City's Innovation Quarter, approximately 15 minutes by sky-rail from the Azure Crescent District.

Despite its technical achievements, HTT faces significant business challenges that Kaigan has inherited:

- A recent failed expansion attempt into commercial passenger transport drained significant capital reserves
- Increasing competition from both larger corporations and agile startups
- The need for substantial new investment to fully capitalize on Prism Plane opportunities
- The loss of Dr. Lysander's personal connections and negotiating prowess with key clients
- An aging primary research facility that requires modernization

Dr. Lysander intentionally kept HTT independent rather than selling to larger conglomerates like The Azkharat Group, valuing scientific integrity over maximum profit. This independence now rests in Kaigan's hands—a responsibility he was never prepared to assume.

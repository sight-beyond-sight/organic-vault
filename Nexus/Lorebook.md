## Nexus Worldbuilding Information:

Here is the information extracted and organized from the file "Nexus, the Rift Sculpted World.json":

### Planes of Existence

* **Heaven:**
    * Plane of existence and source of Aether.
    * Contains the planet Rey'en, desolate moons, cities (including the capital Elysium), Great Houses, heavenly gods, angels, Evern, and the Resonant Structure.
* **Hell:**
    * Plane of existence and source of Flux.
    * Contains the planet Ver, cities (including the capital Pandemonium), Noble Duchies, Demon Lords, hellborne gods, demons, and the Hellborne Structure.
* **Common Realm:**
    * Plane of existence containing planets, stars, moons, galaxies, nebulas, black holes, colonized planets, and the Neutral Structure.
* **Abyss:**
    * Plane of existence containing the planet Stygix, a dim purple star named Hexix, Stygian Voidstone, and Voidborn beings.

### Fundamental Concepts & Energy

* **Structure:**
    * The fundamental fabric of reality.
    * Can manifest as Resonant Structure (Heaven), Hellborne Structure (Hell), Neutral Structure (Common Realm), or Biostructure.
    * Can be manipulated through magic and harnessed with technology.
* **Living Structure:**
    * Category of Structure produced by and sustaining life.
    * Includes Aether (Heavenly), Flux (Hellborne), and Biostructure (Common Realm).
* **Aether (Resonant Aether):**
    * Heavenly Structure; powerful but delicate energy requiring intricate structures to harness.
    * Studied by the field of Aetherics.
* **Flux:**
    * Hellborne Structure; wild, volatile, and extremely energy-dense.
    * Studied by the field of Flux Dynamics.
* **Biostructure:**
    * Energy produced by life in the Common Realm.
    * Supports the structure of life in the Common Realm and is required for the survival of beings from other planes.
* **Rift:**
    * A tear in reality connecting a plane of existence with the Common Realm.
    * Naturally sporadic, unpredictable, and unstable.
    * Can be stabilized with technology.
    * Short-lived (up to one year with stabilizers) and range in diameter from 1 meter to 100 kilometers.

### Species

* **Angels:**
    * **Biology:** Heavenly species, almost always female with horns and wings (sometimes tails/talons). Humanoid. Reproduce with other species, laying 8-10 eggs that hatch into mature adults after one year.
    * **Origin:** Evolved from parasitic worms feeding on heavenly gods. Worms telepathically communicated with human women, entering willing hosts, taking over their bodies/minds (killing the host but preserving some memories), and transforming their genetics/body.
    * **Birth:** Can be parasitic (rare, voluntary surrender to worm) or mothered (daughter of an angel and another species father, father's genetics suppressed).
    * **Types:** Seraphim (close god lineage) and common (distant god lineage).
    * **Bloodlines:** Include Kai (white skin, protruding bones), Yoren (black skin with white patterns), Amiel (multiple wings, colorful skin/feathers), and others.
    * **Nutrition:** Require regular consumption of Aether or Biostructure (can be extracted directly from living beings).
* **Demons:**
    * Hellborne species.
    * Includes Succubi, Incubi, Vampires, Dragons, Dragonyth, Serpex, Arkax, Karxa, and others.
    * **Vampire:** Hellborne demon. Consumes raw Flux or Biostructure. Extracts Biostructure by drinking blood (from Hell's sanguine plants or Common Realm beings); modern consumption is voluntary and legal.
    * **Succubus/Incubus:** Hellborne demon. Consumes raw Flux or Biostructure, often through sexual bodily fluids. Have horns, often tails, rarely wings, and often womb tattoos.
    * **Karxa:** Humanoid demons with feline traits (second set of ears, sharp durable nails, fur covering).
    * **Serpex:** Humanoid demons with snake characteristics.
    * **Arkax:** Demons with a humanoid upper torso and a large arachnid abdomen.
* **Voidborn:**
    * Species originating in the Abyss. Can survive on Aether, Flux, or Biostructure.
    * **Siren:** Mostly female Voidborn. Can hypnotize with song to attract living sources of energy (Biostructure, Aether, Flux).
    * **Styge:Karav (Karav):** Voidborn humanoids with tentacles on their backs used as prehensile organs and for reproduction.
    * **Stygex:Veren (Veren):** Voidborn humanoid plant hybrids capable of photosynthesis, with floral organs.
    * **Stygelesh:Hex (Hex):** Blind, tall Voidborn with intricate exoskeletons and non-standard humanoid forms.

### Technology & Materials

* **Integrated Harmonics (Harmonics):**
    * Cutting-edge field blending Aetherics and Flux Dynamics.
    * Manages the interplay between Aether and Flux, designing systems using both (theoretically dangerous due to annihilation reaction).
    * Made practical using Stygian Voidstone for isolation.
    * Prominent use in space travel (requires Flux power and delicate Aether use).
* **FTL Drive (Warp Drive, Harmonic Engine):**
    * Technology enabling Faster-Than-Light travel.
    * Used in almost all modern spacefaring vessels.
    * Relies on Integrated Harmonics.
* **Aetheric Arrays (Arrays):**
    * Delicate networks of circuits powered by Aether.
    * Used for computation, communication, and precision control. Sophisticated.
* **Flux Reactors:**
    * Massive structures in power plants and starships.
    * Capable of immense energy output using Flux.
* **Stygian Voidstone (Voidstone):**
    * Substance from the Abyss echoing its emptiness.
    * Uniquely absorbs and neutralizes Aether and Flux without violent reaction.
    * Appears as a deep, inky black material impervious to light.
    * Often formed into intricate containment vessels.
* **Prism Crystals**  
    * Store densely‑packed Aether “imprints,” enabling ultra‑fast computation once removed from the Plane.  
    * Disrupt delicate Aetheric circuits in situ; only heavily‑shielded low‑power devices function reliably inside Prism space.
* **Auric Galleon‑Carriers**  
    * LEDGER’s orange‑hulled survey starships whose plating bio‑fuses with living Prism barnacles during long missions, requiring periodic chiselling or guided growth trimming.



### Organizations & Factions

* **Exalted Protectorate (Protectorate):**
    * Oversight body for all Colonized Space, focusing on space travel and interplanar relations.
    * Sluggish, slow, prone to internal bickering, but acts decisively and brutally (especially regarding colonization claims).
    * Commands the Zenith Blades military force to enforce Edicts (strongest legislation).
    * Edicts require support from representatives of each plane, ensuring neutrality but making them rare and usually targeting smaller factions.
    * Corporations can only consult/advise, not vote, in Ultima (hall of power in New Babylon).
* **Crown Eclipse:**
    * Bioengineering corporation formed by a coalition of Demon Lords.
    * Architects of the Exyn Project.

    * Largest competitive fighting organization in Colonized Space.
    * Owned by The Azkharat Group.
* *Free Association of the LEDGER Cartography Mission (LEDGER)**  
    * *Motto:* “We draw the lines that others dare to cross.”  
    * Provides 99.97 %‑accurate navigation data and weather forecasts within the Prism Plane.  
    * **Structure:**  
        * **Board of Surveyors** – five seats (3 angelic, 1 fallen‑angel, 1 voidborn).  
        * **Field Cohorts** – 42‑member crews rotating six‑week Prism deployments.  
    * **Sealed‑Orange Protocol:** field units may use lethal force to protect mission‑critical data; their bright‑orange hull plating is recognised across Colonized Space.  
    * **Signature Assets:** Auric Galleon‑Carriers (orange survey starships), Keepsake Cores (data‑replay crystals).



### Locations

### History & Timeline

* **Current Year:** 3200 CE (Common Era).
* **Year 0 CE:** Marked by the appearance of the Rifts of Raythen (first recorded Rifts to Heaven and Hell at an ancient temple on Terra).
* **Exyn Project:**
    * Demonic bioengineering project by Crown Eclipse to compete with angelic reproduction.
    * Produces artificially grown adult demons (Exyn) with advantageous traits from multiple species in a one-year vat process.
    * **Start Date:** 3170 CE. 
    * **Current State:** Ongoing.
    * **Exyn Details:** Genetics manipulated via Structure. Appearance/abilities vary by generation/lab. Examples: increased longevity, enhanced senses, biomechanical camouflage, demonplate limbs.
    * **Use:** Integrated into workforces, military, or sent on dangerous mining operations.
    * **Assignment:** Process for Exyn to pay off their creation debt to Crown Eclipse, involving contract work as servants, workers, or soldiers.
* * **Prism‑Frontier Decade (3190 - 3200)**  
    * **0 AF – Halo Fracture:** first stable Rift blooms above Calypso, opening access to the newly‑discovered *Prism Plane*.  
    * **2 AF – Expansion Rush:** secondary Rifts manifest across Colonized Space; Faster‑Than‑Light travel fails in Prism space, forcing sub‑light “slow‑crawl” expeditions.  The **Free Association of the LEDGER Cartography Mission** (LEDGER) forms, providing the first reliable star‑charts.  
    * **4 AF – Edict 77‑B:** the Exalted Protectorate limits Prism‑crystal exports and posts Zenith Blade blockades; LEDGER vessels become coveted “safe‑passage” escorts.  
    * **7 AF – Vertex Founded:** survey outpost on **Yarim** (moon of Nentar‑darksim) grows into *Vertex City*, the first permanent settlement inside the Prism Plane.  
    * **10 AF – Prism‑Core Breakthrough:** data‑dense Prism crystals revolutionise processor design outside the Plane, granting LEDGER priceless leverage.
* ## Notable Individuals

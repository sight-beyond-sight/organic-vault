### The prompt
Create a short summary/description of the Affiniere scenario with only one love-servant. Change her name to Kaede. The protagonist's name is Kaigan. Additional details: the inheritance includes a space travel R&D and logistics company, as well as the residence we've mentioned before. There are several servants and staff, with Kaede leading the maid staff (all Cuorelle maids). All of them are women (Cuorelle is a traditional, female-only organization). Additional details you will need to flesh out: the specifics of the company, the name of the inventor/entrepreneur and his/her details, details of Cuorelle and Affinieres in particular. Changes/things to keep in mind: Kaede is a fallen angel. Her bloodline is significantly mutated and the only mark of her angelism is her horns. Other than that, she looks like a Varxa demon (cousin species of Karxa, instead of feline characteristics they have fox-like characteristics. Their second set of ears is larger and fluffier, their tails are fluffy and long). She has black hair, long but typically worn up. Natural red and purple streaks of colour run through her hair. Her tail is large, fluffy. Her Varxa ears and tail are also primarily black, with violet and red strands towards their respective tips, but she often dyes them one or the other to look more orderly. Her eyes are bright azure. Natural tattoos typical of both demonic and angelic blood adorn her body in abstract organic shapes or floral motifs. The tattoos are black naturally, but she sometimes dyes them in purple or azure as well. They change with the seasons, marking natural biological patterns of Structure. Specialized tattoo artists can imprint desired patterns, coaxing the body into producing its natural marks in the chosen shapes and places on the body. She sometimes chooses these services, available at salons all over Calypso, to compliment a certain look or outfit. As stated, her horns mark her as a Fallen Angel. She hails from a metallic angelic bloodline, so her horns are made of enchanted metal, purple and cyan. The horns are also seasonal and she sheds them every few months (can be faster or slower depending on biological/astral factors). They sprout from her temples. Left to themselves, they tend to grow into upwards-facing inward-curving swooping shapes and can be 50-70cm long. However, it's common for angels to shape and trip their horns as they grow, applying heat or minor spellcasting to control the shape of the horns' growth and cutting unwanted shapes or splits (or inducing them). This is painless, since the horns do not contain nerves and are purely cosmetic. Close to the moment of shedding, the horns become brittle. They fall by themselves but are usually snapped or cut purposefully around this time. A new growth can take a week or two to fully form. Older angels tend to have longer horns, and the specifics vary between angelic (or fallen angelic) species. Kaede keeps up with fashions and styles herself in diverse, elegant ways. All Cuorelle maids receive thorough fashion and styling education, but Attaches are especially expected to maintain good looks, seen as a sign of respect and social status for their clients. Kaede's skin is fair but not porcelain white, she stands at 167cm tall, and she is wingless. She has 59 sisters (fallen angels reproduce through eggs and are generally as prolific as regular angels), and many of them are also maids. Her mother occupies an important position within the Cuorelle order. This is Kaede's first ever Affiniere contract, after serving in smaller contracts (ranging from cleaning to bodyguard duty). Affiniere contracts typically last until the death of their client. The contract involves surrendering oneself completely to their client (traditionally referred to as Master/Mistress), but abuse is prohibited (physical/emotional violence, torture and so on). Marriage is permitted but it is not mandatory, the maid must freely consent of her own will. A married maid no longer belongs to the Order if dismissed by the client or after the client's death, becoming an honorary member of the Order instead, free to pursue her own family or career goals.

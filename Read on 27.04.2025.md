Things to do today:

Set up portfolio notion! 
That means update the current roadmap and write a dev-log page.

The actual development:

Implement ScriptableObjects and components for the towers (they might already have components)
- Actually read the code again, line by line
- Define stats struct
- Divide between stats the tower needs to know vs stats the module needs to know
- Write IModule definition
- Figure out the first method: Attack(), and how this can be called without Tower knowing about it

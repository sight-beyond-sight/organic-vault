I think a lot of my issues stem from [[Parasocial Presence]] . This means starting a task on a project is harder because of the cost of leaving the parasocial presence, and playing a single player game is as well. My dependency on it is probably the leading cause of me not being able to enrich myself from games, films, shows and books more.

We need to get better. Denial and self-punishment won't work. So acknowledge it, balance it, harmonize. You *need* socialization, community, friends. And podcasts/videos aren't bad. There's a place  for video + game or video + food. But when it's everything you do... well, you know the story. Everything works like that. And your role is the mediator, the judge, the wise advisor. So convoke your council.

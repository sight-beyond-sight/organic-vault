BUT also people are "malleable"
Ne supunem legilor

Premise of GOV: More marriages
Dynamic of converted - if parents cared so much, thin slice
Dynamic of person 1 - if parents cared so much, insularity
Pressure from family

Autonomy - literally inherent to motion

Arg 1 religious equality

Principle-based burden

1. Targets ONE non intrinsically damaging practice
Targets based on non-human-rights based moral judgment, fundamental societal clash
Similar to: burkini ban


Institutional chauvinism
Consecrated power dynamics antithetical to liberal order
Need to justify religious supremacy

 
Weighing: 
Inherent to any formulation of motion

Arg 2 Religious insularization

Group 1: religious moderates - amenable
Group 2: 

Distrust of liberal agenda
Core to destabilization/radicalization

Insularity of religion


~Nu este inerent discriminatoriu~

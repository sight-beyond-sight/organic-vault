It just makes me angry. The highs are not worth the lows. I don't need this in my life, I can move on and enjoy other games.  In a different context, maybe with friends, it's worth playing.

But it's not right now and I can move on and I can enjoy other  games and actually play games for a change.

I need to remember that the ups are mediocre and the time is better spent elsewhere. For a year, I'll stop playing league, just to see what it's like.
